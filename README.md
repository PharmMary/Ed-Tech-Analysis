## INTRODUCTION
Data Analysis of an online, educational technology platform that offers a wide range of courses on a variety of topics, at different proficiency level.  

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem to be solved with data mining is to understand the performance of each course, gain insights into the business, improve efficiency and determine the relationship between cost of enrolling in a course and number of students enrolled in the course.

## DATA SOURCE
 The data set was provided by the company from their e-learning platform. It contained features like number of subscribers by course, name of course, enrollment fee, number of reviews received for a course, number of instruction sessions per course, proficiency level of course, length of course content and discipline to which the course belongs.
 
 ## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

 ### Insights from Above
- In 2011, the company published a total of 5 courses which were all in web development, 1 was designed for beginners and 4 for all the levels, all the courses published that year had 100% subscription.
- In 2012, the company published a total 45 courses across the following field of study, Web Developement Business Finance, musical instruments and graphic design,the courses were taught at all the levels of study, all the courses had 100% subscription.
- In 2013, a total of 201 courses were published and they all had 100% subscription.
- In 2014, 492 were published, majority(39%) of the courses were in the field of Business finance and the least(13%) in the field of Graphics Designs. All the courses had subscribers except 6 courses under the field of Graphic design, 3 of the course are for beginner level.¶
- In 2015, the courses published was doubled(1,014) and they all had subscribers except for 1 course under business finance which was designed for all level proficiency.
- In 2016 the courses published were increased by almost 20%(1,205), but only web development field recorded 100% subscription among the field of study, also the expert level recorded 100% subscription.
- In 2017, the company reduced the number of courses published to 714 courses, still only web development courses and the entire expert level courses had 100% subscription.

  ### Insights from the Heatmap
- There is a very weak positive relationship between price of enrolling for an online course and number of subscribers.
- There is a strong positive correlation between Revenue generated and Number of Reviews, & Course duration and Number of lectures. Also a moderate correlation between Revenue generated and Number of Subscribers & Number of Reviews and Number of subscribers.

The p-value is approximately 0.0022 (<0.05), therefore the correlation is statistically significant. The correlation is unlikely to occur by chance , it is more likely to reflect a genuine relationship between the cost of enrolling for a course and number of subscribers.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the insights above:
The Ed-Tech institution is doing excellently well in web development field of study, and Expert Level courses across all the field of studies, despite the increase in course price and a drop-in revenue generated in 2017, 100% subscription was recorded in these areas of studies all through the years. The of musical instrument is not performing well. A change in cost of enrolling may affect the number of subscribers generally.

Therefore I recommended, the following:

- Publish more courses in the field of Web development as they are highly sort after and generate a lot of revenue.
- Focus the course titles in the field of musical instruments around the ones that are highly subscribed to under this field.
- The courses under the Expert level are few compared to other levels, increasing the number of Expert level courses will increase company’s revenue, since they are highly sort after.
- Increasing cost of enrolling for a course affected subscription, therefore the cost of enrolling should be reduced except for courses under Web development and those under the Expert Level.
- Always request for written out feedbacks along side with the ratings to enable one understand why a course is rated high or low, for proper evaluation.
